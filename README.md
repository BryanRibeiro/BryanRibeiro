A young protagonist, I am a values oriented person, I like to make things happen, solve problems and bring significant changes to the world.

I'm passionate about innovation and I love technology and music. I believe that development and evolution are constant processes in our lives, so I always try to study and learn more and more and always share with others, everything I learned.

A dedicated and loyal person with the goals set for me. I like challenges and situations that take me out of my comfort zone and my main goal in life is to participate in building a better world and leave my mark and legacy on it.
